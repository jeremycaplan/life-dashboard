# Life Experience Dashboard üéØ

**[Try the Life Experience Dashboard Here](https://jeremycaplan.github.io/life-dashboard/)**

A powerful visualization tool that helps you understand and optimize your remaining life experiences. Track your reading habits, movie watching, concert attendance, and holiday celebrations with meaningful metrics and actionable insights.

## Overview üåü

Life Experience Dashboard is designed to help you visualize your life in months and track various life experiences to make the most of your time. It provides personalized calculations based on your age, gender, and life goals.

## Features üìä

### 1. Life Timeline Visualization
- Visual representation of lived and remaining months
- Based on current age and gender-specific life expectancy data
- Life expectancy calculations sourced from demographic data via [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/average-life-expectancy-chart-wix98lEjQjC.0KulgpXIzA)

### 2. Reading Experience Tracker
**Calculations:**
- Books per year = (Daily reading time √ó Reading days per week √ó 52 weeks) / (60 minutes √ó Pages per book / Reading speed)
- Lifetime potential = Books per year √ó Remaining years
- Reading gap = (Goal books - Current books) √ó Remaining years

### 3. Movie Watching Tracker
**Calculations:**
- Movies per month tracking
- Lifetime movie potential = Monthly movies √ó 12 months √ó Remaining years
- Movie gap = (Goal movies - Current movies) √ó 12 √ó Remaining years

### 4. Concert Attendance Tracker
**Calculations:**
- Concerts per month tracking
- Lifetime concert potential = Monthly concerts √ó 12 months √ó Remaining years
- Concert gap = (Goal concerts - Current concerts) √ó 12 √ó Remaining years

### 5. Thanksgiving Celebrations
**Calculations:**
- Remaining celebrations = Thanksgivings per year √ó Remaining years
- Celebration hours = Remaining celebrations √ó 4 hours (assumed average celebration duration)
